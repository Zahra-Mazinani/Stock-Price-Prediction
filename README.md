# Stock-Price-Prediction
This repo code is about LSTM/GRU-based networks for time series data prediction.
It was just an exercise to learn and work with these neural networks.

The data used for this project was [Disney finance data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIldUd0I-fO6ohr9RG630yCK6Z51ITQyT4ueUIRu-LsE1K7IK2wzVQbJCqPOmdnjOrqC4cxuk7yw-O1-Cia4fiXG6YG2VqA2jTl-3lNlY7iHIw5bdwnFsnlRyDyPPUEWA8aocstzganl6tnAuPIpzG7bNo2xKZBwlsDpkaTKSklc).

We chose a window to give the model sequentially observation and then predict the next step.
